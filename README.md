# cool-admin-provisioner-iam #

[![GitHub Build Status](https://github.com/cisagov/cool-admin-provisioner-iam/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cisagov/cool-admin-provisioner-iam/actions)

This is a Terraform deployment for creating IAM resources for those
users allowed to provision any environment in the COOL.

## Pre-requisites ##

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) installed on your system.
- An accessible AWS S3 bucket to store Terraform state
  (specified in [backend.tf](backend.tf)).
- An accessible AWS DynamoDB database to store the Terraform state lock
  (specified in [backend.tf](backend.tf)).
- Access to all of the Terraform remote states specified in
  [remote_states.tf](remote_states.tf).
- User accounts for all users must have been created previously.  We
  recommend using the
  [`cisagov/cool-users-non-admin`](https://github.com/cisagov/cool-users-non-admin)
  repository to create users.

## Usage ##

1. Create a Terraform workspace (if you haven't already done so) by running
   `terraform workspace new <workspace_name>`
1. Create a `<workspace_name>.tfvars` file with all of the required
  variables (see [Inputs](#Inputs) below for details):

  ```hcl
  users = [
    "firstname1.lastname1",
    "firstname2.lastname2"
  ]
  ```

1. Run the command `terraform init`.
1. Run the command `terraform apply -var-file=<workspace_name>.tfvars`.
